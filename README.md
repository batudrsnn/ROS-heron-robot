# ROS-heron-robot
The paper of the final project is included in the files.

The project includes,
• a navigation module that tackles the problem of finding its way in the
environment without crushing into things,
• a manipulation module that allows the robot to pickup objects and place
them on a table and
• a perception module to help the robot to see the object it should pick.

The SkiROS2 is used to automatically handle coordination of individual modules.
